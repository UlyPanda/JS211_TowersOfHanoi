My readme plan for towers of hanoi game!

1. You win by stacking all four blocks from column A onto another column either column B or C going from biggest to smallest to make a tower in the allowed amount of moves.
2. Can only move the last block on any column. Can only stack on column B or C.
3. Game starts out in the solution order on column a.
4. Needs to check and not allow for illegal moves. Larger blocks are not allowed to be stacked on smaller ones.
5. Needs to check for win!
